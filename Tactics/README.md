# Protest tactics
- Be like water "Water cant be destroyed. If you burn it, it turns to vapour then turns back to water. If you freeze it, it turns to ice. When the ice melts, it turns back to water. Be resilient like water. It will frustrate your enemies and restate your dominance." [Protest tactics used in Hong Kong](Be-like-water.md).






_No one equals Anonymous, no single group, network can be representative of Anonymous as a whole. If anyone claims to 'represent' it, lies no exceptions. Anonymous is also not a democratic body, which means a majority of anons can not be considered representative of Anonymous either. ~Anonymous_
