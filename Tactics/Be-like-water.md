## Be like water protest tactics.
### SUPPLY CHAIN:
- A human chain delivers a steady flow of helmets, umbrellas, masks, and goggles to the front line. This is faster and creates less extra foot traffic, and it allows moving protesters to skirt the area where the chain is operating.

- This diagram shows the flow of supplies along a human chain to the front line, and indicates where crowds of protesters can march past without interfering.

### HAND SIGNALS:
- Protesters have developed simple hand signals to communicate. Soldiers have always used visual signals in battle. They carry over long distances in noisy environments.

- Protesters use plastic wrap (cling wrap) around the uncovered parts of their face, neck, and forearms to shield skin from OC spray, PAVA (pelargonic acid vanillylamide), and CS irritant

- Not all protesters will be wearing full protective gear (like full-face gas masks). It's expensive and difficult to obtain. Protesters make do with what they have, with support.

- Makeshift barricades are crucial to stopping the police "Zerg rush", where they charge protesters, knock some to the ground, and arrest them.

### BARRICADE CONSTRUCTION:

- Barricades are easily assembled from found items like fences, railings, and construction equipment. Note the use of zip ties. The barricade protects from the police Zerg rush, a common arrest tactic.

### BARRICADE DEPLOYMENT:

- Barricades are used to protect from police clearance operations. As we've seen in Portland, police like to launch surprise "clearing" attacks against the flanks of the crowd while protesters are distracted by the front. Video: https://vimeo.com/447239654

- Quickly deploy barricades to protect the front line's vulnerable flanks. Allow wide-open egress from front lines to "green" zone territory (owned by large crowds of friendlies). Don't create chokepoints or trample hazards. Video: https://vimeo.com/447240219

- Protesters will need cable ties and sturdy scissors (get blunt-tipped shears, so you can't be accused of carrying a pointed weapon).
